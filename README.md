# GetItDone

Concept: A time tracking program for college and university to help you stick to your plans and be more productive.
Implementation in Python.


Feature Checklist
* Focuses on the user spending less time laying out their work plans, and more time spent actually getting work done
	* The only regular input required from the user should be starting/stopping a timer for registering the time they spend on a task and what task they're working on
* Timetable View
  * The user can compare the timetable with all the tasks they completed for a day with a timetable showing what the user wanted to work on during different blocks of time throughout the day (the user can set this up)  
* Alerts
  * Alerts the user when they should start working on their next task that is set up on their timetable, records if the user did start working on the task or not
* Shows the user their "productivity pulse" based on the amount of work the user has accomplished thus far
  * Encourages the user to keep working
* Desktop app with a mobile companion

Advanced Features
* The app can estimate how long a user will take to complete a task, based on the time they've spent completing similar tasks previously
